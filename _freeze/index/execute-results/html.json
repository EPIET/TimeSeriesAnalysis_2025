Preferably, the installation of these applications should be done in the stated order: R \\>\\> RTools \\>\\> RStudio. If you don’t have these applications installed yet, please do so following the instructions below:\n\n-   **R** should be installed in the participants’ computer. You can download it from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/), on the section “Download and Install R”. Select the adequate version to your computer’s operating system.\n\n    -   Latest version available is 4.5.2 (31^st^ Oct 2025). [*You don’t need the latest version installed.*]{.underline} However, it’s highly recommended to stay updated on at least the ‘major version’ (4.x.x) and not too many ‘minor versions’ (x.5.x) away, as packages tend to update to each of them. A warning message might show when using p_load if your R version is older than a package’s last update; however, it will work fine.\n\n    -   Multiple versions of R can be installed in one’s computer. R usually can be installed without administrative rights. If you have more than one R version installed on your computer, please make sure that you select the specific version 4.2.3. when running RStudio (Top Menu: Settings \\> Global Options \\> Left Panel \\> R)\n\n-   **RTools at the same R version you are using** should also be installed in the participants’ computer. You can download the necessary files by clicking [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) and selecting the corresponding operating system in your computer.\n\n    -   For MacOS, RTools installation comprises the minimal installation of clang and gfortran as listed in the hyperlinked website. Please note that preferably only one version of RTools version 4.2 or below should be installed in one’s computer. RTools version 4.3 can be installed simultaneously with RTools version 4.2. or below in one’s computer.\n\n-   [**RStudio**](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) can be used with previous versions without creating conflict with packages or R versions safely. Try to keep updated if possible.\n\n## Libraries {.unnumbered}\n\n**The following R packages have to be installed**. Open RStudio, copy the highlighted code below into the R Console pane and press enter. [This process might take several minutes.]{.underline}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install pacman if not installed already, and activate it\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\")\n\n# Install, update and activate libraries\npacman::p_load(\n  here, \n  rio, \n  skimr,\n  tsibble,\n  ISOweek,\n  slider,\n  pander,\n  season,\n  lmtest,\n  TSA,\n  ciTools,\n  gtsummary,\n  patchwork,\n  AER,\n  MASS,\n  sjPlot,\n  tidyverse\n)\n\n\n## packages to be installed for outbreak detection / loaded by pacman\npacman::p_load(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"United4Surveillance/signal-detection-tool\")\n\n\n## packages to be installed for multilevel / loaded by pacman\npacman::p_load(devtools)\ndevtools::install_github(\"goodekat/redres\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Frequent problems you may encounter during the SignalDetectionTool installation:**\n\n-   Please start a new R session before the installation by going in Rstudio to Session \n\n    -   [Solution]{.underline}: RStudio menu bar \\> Session \\> New Session\n\n-   In case you get an error message that some package with version x.x.x. is already loaded in the namespace, but a higher version is requested, you should try:\n\n    -   Make a new R session\n\n    -   If 1) did not work, then manually install_packages(package_with_problem).\n\n    -   Install the SignalDetectionTool again\n\nIn case you have troubles accessing Github check below\n\n**Installation Instructions for the SignalDetectionTool in case of problems with GitHub access**\n\n1.  Save the file signal-detection-tool-0.8.0.tar.gz on your computer\n\n2.  Open RStudio and run `install.packages(\"remotes\")`\n\n3.  Install all dependencies for the SignalDetectionTool by running and filling in your path to the stored .tar.gz with the command `remotes::install_deps(\"your_path_to_signal-detection-tool-0.8.0.tar.gz\"`\n\n4.  Install the SignalDetectionTool by running `install.packages(\"your_path_to_signal-detection-tool-0.8.0.tar.gz\", repos = NULL, type = \"source\")`\n",
