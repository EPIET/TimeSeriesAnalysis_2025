# Managing date formats and plotting {#title-3 .unnumbered}

## Expected learning outcomes {#learning-3 .unnumbered}

By the end of the session, participants should be able to:

-   Import surveillance data into statistical software

-   Manage surveillance datasets with different date formats

-   Plot surveillance data against time

You have been provided with one MS Excel file (`tsa_practice.xlsx`) containing 2 sheets, one for each of two different diseases (**dis1**, **dis2**); and one csv file called (`tsa_pumala.csv`) about Puumala virus infections in Finland.

## Task 3.1

Visually assess the reported number of each disease by ISO (epidemiological) week or calendar month for all the data provided (optional: "dis2").

What diseases do you think they are, judging from their distribution in time?
