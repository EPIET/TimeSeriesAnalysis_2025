    "text": "Description of the dataset\nRotavirus is a very common and potentially serious infection of the large bowel, mainly affecting young babies. Nearly every child will have at least one episode of rotavirus gastroenteritis by five years of age. People of any age can be affected, but the illness is more severe in young infants. The rotavirus immunisation programme was introduced in the UK on 1 July 2013 (week 27) with the objective of preventing a significant number of young infants from developing rotavirus infection. It may also provide some additional protection to the wider population through herd immunity. The aim of the rotavirus immunisation programme is to provide two doses of vaccine to infants from six weeks of age and before 24 weeks of age. The first dose of vaccine is offered at approximately eight weeks of age and the second dose at least four weeks after the first dose.\nHigh coverage was rapidly achieved for the first cohort of children offered rotavirus vaccine routinely in England and this has been maintained throughout the first fourteen months of the routine programme. Over this period, rotavirus vaccine coverage for children in the routine cohort averaged 93.3% for one dose and 88.3% for two doses.1",

We need to check whether our data exhibit overdispersion.\nOverdispersion occurs when the mean of the data is not equal to its variance, violating the fundamental assumption of the Poisson distribution. If this happens, the model underestimates the standard error of the coefficients, biasing results towards narrower confidence intervals and artifically lower p-values.\nLet’s check for overdispersion. We can calculate an overdispersion parameter from a model as the ratio of the deviance and the residuals degrees of freedom. Also, proper statistical test are available, for example using the AER library and the dispersiontest function\n\n\nShow the code\n# Quick check for overdispersion: if check &gt; 1 then use negative binomial\ndeviance &lt;- summary(rotamodel_prevacc_p)$deviance\nresidual.df &lt;- summary(rotamodel_prevacc_p)$df.residual\n\ncheck &lt;- deviance / residual.df\ncheck\n\n\n[1] 366.1138\n\n\nShow the code\n# Proper check for overdispersion: \nAER::dispersiontest(rotamodel_prevacc_p, trafo = NULL, alternative = c(\"greater\"))\n\n\n\n    Overdispersion test\n\ndata:  rotamodel_prevacc_p\nz = 7.2434, p-value = 2.188e-13\nalternative hypothesis: true dispersion is greater than 1\nsample estimates:\ndispersion \n   446.172 \n\n\nThe overdispersion parameter is fairly greater that 1, and the overdispersion test is significant, so we can safely conclude that a negative binomial model is more appropiate.
